1. CONTRAINDICATED: AVOID COMBINING WARFARIN WITH ST JOHN’S WORT

    Advise immediate discontinuation of St John’s Wort and refer for medical review [2].

    Warn that St John’s Wort reduces warfarin levels and INR via CYP induction [1].

    If already exposed, recommend urgent INR monitoring until stabilised [1].

    Warfarin currently out of stock; consider ordering if needed for resumption [Inventory].

2. TREAT OPIOID CONSTIPATION WITH STOOL SOFTENER; STIMULANT CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE

    First-line senna unavailable; consider ordering and use docusate 100 mg TDS as interim [1].

    Continue laxative prophylactically for duration of opioid use [1].

    Review opioid efficacy for back pain; consider tapering and non-drug therapies [2].

3. CONTRAINDICATED: AVOID SIMVASTATIN WITH CLARITHROMYCIN DUE TO RHABDOMYOLYSIS RISK

    Withhold simvastatin during clarithromycin treatment; resume 3 days after final dose [2].

    Pravastatin preferred alternative but currently unavailable; consider ordering [2].

    Clarithromycin increases simvastatin levels via CYP3A4 inhibition; risk of myopathy [1].

4. STOP METFORMIN IMMEDIATELY; RENAL FUNCTION TOO LOW FOR SAFE USE

    Discontinue metformin at eGFR 25 due to lactic acidosis risk [1].

    Sitagliptin suitable but currently unavailable; consider ordering [2].

    Initiate insulin glargine with renal-adjusted dosing if glycaemic control needed [2].

    Urgently review diabetes plan with prescriber [1].

5. AMOXICILLIN SUSPENSION REQUIRED FOR 4-YEAR-OLD; CURRENTLY OUT OF STOCK

    First-line amoxicillin suspension unavailable; consider ordering [1].

    Do not use 500 mg capsules for age 4—dose and form inappropriate [1].

    Prescribe 40–90 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days if suitable form obtained [1][2].

    Refer to prescriber to arrange appropriate formulation or alternative [1].

6. AVOID COMBINING LISINOPRIL WITH POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTS UNLESS SPECIALIST-MONITORED

    Do not co-administer lisinopril with potassium chloride due to hyperkalaemia risk [1].

    Combination requires specialist supervision and close biochemical monitoring [1].

    Check serum potassium and creatinine within 1 week if combination deemed necessary [2].

    Lisinopril currently out of stock; consider ordering if still clinically indicated [Inventory].

7. FIRST-LINE NITROFURANTOIN UNAVAILABLE; CONSIDER CO-AMOXICLAV IF CULTURE SUPPORTS

    Nitrofurantoin 100 mg MR BD for 7 days is first-line (avoid at term) [1].

    First-line option currently unavailable; consider ordering [1].

    Use co-amoxiclav only if culture confirms susceptibility [2].

    Send urine sample and refer to prescriber for safe interim plan [2].

8. AVOID IBUPROFEN WITH WARFARIN DUE TO BLEEDING RISK

    Do not use ibuprofen with warfarin; increased risk of GI bleeding and potentiation [1].

    Paracetamol preferred but currently out of stock; consider ordering [2].

    If NSAID essential, use gastroprotection (e.g. omeprazole) and monitor INR closely [1].

    Refer to prescriber for safe analgesia plan [2].

9. NAPROXEN IN ELDERLY REQUIRES PPI COVER; OMEPRAZOLE CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE

    Co-prescribe PPI with naproxen to reduce GI bleed risk; omeprazole out of stock—consider ordering [1].

    Use lowest effective naproxen dose for shortest duration [1].

    Assess renal, cardiovascular, and hepatic risks before starting NSAID [2].

    Refer to prescriber if PPI cover or alternative analgesia is needed [1].

10. SKIP MISSED OZEMPIC DOSE IF NEXT DOSE IS LESS THAN 48 HOURS AWAY

    If ≥48 hrs before next dose, take missed semaglutide dose promptly [1].

    If <48 hrs, skip missed dose and resume usual schedule [1].

    Do not take two doses within 48 hours [1].

    Continue monitoring blood glucose and maintain usual lifestyle measures [2].
